# expression-evaluator
This is a simple but useful Java program I built to evaluate arithmetic expressions.   To make this work, I used a stack-based algorithm to first convert the standard infix notation into postfix notation ,After converting it, the program then evaluates the postfix expression and shows the final answer.
